Here I have published my Rstudio script and the index for our activity 3 project. I accidentally published with just the Rproject and decided to leave it up and publish the index with it. 
I have no thoughts on this dataset or how it could be used in the future, this was a small sample chosen at random to do the assigment. 
I will be sure to take what I have learned and apply it to my final project when I find datasets that are aligned with my report.
